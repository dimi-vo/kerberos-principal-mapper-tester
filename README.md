# Copy From Apache Kafka

This is pretty much a copy of the classes from
the [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/4.0.0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/kerberos)
project that are used for the principal to local mapping rules.

The idea is to help in the definition of the rules.

You can edit the rules and default realm in the `Main` class.
